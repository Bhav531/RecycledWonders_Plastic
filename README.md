# RecycledWonders_Plastic
I made a website on Recycled Wonders â€“ Turning Plastic into Art. This website showcases a school project where students creatively transform plastic waste into functional art and eco-friendly solutions. The site features our vision, mission, and impact, along with a step-by-step process of how students work together to build projects like mini greenhouses, eco-brick benches, and bottle-cap mosaics. There are dedicated sections for cross-curricular learning, a gallery of student creations, and testimonials. The website aims to raise awareness about environmental sustainability, promote creativity, and inspire others to adopt recycling as a way of life.

This website is fully functional and made using HTML, CSS and JS
